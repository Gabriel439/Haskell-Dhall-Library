# `dhall-docs`

:construction: **This tool is on development phase yet. It is not usable right now.**

For installation or development instructions, see:

* [`dhall-haskell` - `README`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/blob/master/README.md)

## Introduction

This `dhall-docs` package provides a cli utility that takes a dhall package or
file and outputs a HTML documentation of it.

## Usage

The easiest usage is the following:

```bash
dhall-docs --input ${PACKAGE-FOLDER}
```

`dhall-docs` will store the documentation in
`${XDG_DATA_HOME}/dhall-docs/${OUTPUT-HASH}-${PACKAGE-NAME}/`, where:

* `$XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable comes from the
    [xdg](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
    specification. If it is not defined, `dhall-docs` will default to
    `~/.local/share/`.
* `OUTPUT-HASH` is the hash of the generated documentation. This is to make the
    folder [content-addressable](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Addressed_Storage).
    Also it avoids overwriting documentation folder when there was a change on
    the way it was generated.
* `PACKAGE-NAME` is the package name of your documentation. By default, it will
    be the basename of the `--input` folder, but you can override it via
    `--package-name`.

After generating the documentation, `dhall-docs` will create a symlink to the
documentation index at `./docs/index.html`. You can customize the location of
that symlink using `--output-link` flag, like this:

```bash
dhall-docs --input . --output-link ${OTHER_LINK}
```

For more information about the tool, check the `--help` flag.

## Development

### `ghci`

If you want to open the `ghci` repl on this package using `stack`, you have to
provide an additional flag:

```bash
stack ghci dhall-docs --flag dhall-docs:ghci-data-files
```

... otherwise the file-embedded css and fonts won't be properly linked

### Generated docs on Hydra

At this moment, the only package generated by `dhall-docs` on hydra jobsets is
the Dhall Prelude.
